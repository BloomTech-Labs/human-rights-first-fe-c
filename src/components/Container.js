                We collected data from various sources, including Reddit,

                and classification algorithms to display only incidents of
                police brutality and their corresponding tags.

                Human Rights First is an independent advocacy and action
                organization that challenges America to live up to its ideals.
                We believe American leadership is essential in the global
                struggle for human rights, so we press the U.S. government and
                private companies to respect human rights and the rule of law.
                When they fail, we step in to demand reform, accountability and
                justice. Around the world, we work where we can best harness
                American influence to secure core freedoms.
