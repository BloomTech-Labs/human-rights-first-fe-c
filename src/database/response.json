They're gonna fucking regret that.\"\n\nIt is unclear how the protest unfolded, and why the police were advancing on the crowd wearing riot gear; police allege that the protest turned violent and some protesters say that they were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets while peacefully protesting or retreating.

Later in the night, an officer ordered Burness to turn around and walk in the opposite direction (toward a large cloud of tear gas). He shouted \"press,\" but the officer raised his weapon, forcing Burness (and an associate in a neon \"press\" vest) to walk into the tear gas. Journalist Dave Sachs claims something similar happened to him -- he showed his press pass to police but they shoved him into tear gas.\n\nBurness states that he was gassed on Clarkson st near the Good Times restaurant (808 E Colfax).",

Footage is pointed at the ground, but audio shows individuals arguing. The LRAD's characteristic dispersal signal is used twice, each time without warning and for about 30 seconds. In addition, a photojournalist at the scene confirms the LRAD was used.\n\nDue to its high risk of permanent injury, indiscriminate damage, and insufficient testing surrounding long-terms effects, the use of the LRAD dispersal function is considered to be police brutality in and of itself.",

However, the arrested individuals declined the allegations. The protesters followed the police outside the Capitol, and one of the protesters blocked their path and later the crowd tried to pull the arrestees from the custody of the police officers. That is when more crowds and police started to get involved. Police used pepper spray to help disperse the crowd and arrested 17 people, including two juveniles.",

A female cop stood by while a male cop patted them down. The journalist states the male cop's \"hands aggressively slid over my vagina and my ass.\"\n\nThey were held in a cell for several hours, in and out of cuffs.

The independent reporter was held longer than The Daily Caller reporter, but appears to have been released early on October 9th.

The officers tell the Daily Caller reporter to leave the are. He states he is press but returns to his car in the parking lot nonetheless. Officers follow him to his car, causing the incident.\n\nThe independent journalist has since tweeted that he sustained a concussion.",

Several arrests were made including Reverend Drumwright of the Citadel Church and Rion Thompson who was the campaign manager for Dreama Caldwell, a Democratic candidate for county commissioner.\n\nOne woman in a wheelchair suffered a seizure as a result of the pepper spray. Several children including two young girls ages 5 and 11 were caught by the pepper spray. The mother of the two girls said her daughters both vomited due to the effects of the spray. Several journalists were also pepper sprayed.\n\nThe last link shows US House candidate Scott Huffman giving his account for the events that transpired.\n\nActions seem to have been committed jointly by Graham Police and Alamance County Sheriffs.",
