## Project Overview

1️⃣ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/QD7rXL7v/labs25hrfthierry)

1️⃣ [Product Canvas](https://whimsical.com/47hccoy2w65yxpK8dSfpwz)

Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for Human Rights First, an independent advocacy and action organization.

We're pulling data from similiar APIs(All locations V2 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020PB/police-brutality/data_build/all-locations-v2.json, 846- https://api.846policebrutality.com/api/incidents) and from Twitter and Reddit. We want to identify aggregate these instances.

# APIs

## 2️⃣ Data Science API

We are sending json objects to the backend with information about instances of police use of force. This information includes location data (city, state, and geocode) and relevant details about the incident, like the type of force that was used.

## 2️⃣ PRAW

PRAW, The Python Reddit API Wrapper, makes it easy for users to analyze Reddit data. We used PRAW to scrape Reddit for potential instances of police of force.

## 3️⃣ Tweepy

Tweepy is a Python library that allows users to access the Twitter API. We used Tweepy to scan Twitter to find instances of police use of force.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  PRAW_CLIENT_ID  - keys for Reddit API
    *  PRAW_CLIENT_SECRET - keys for Reddit API
    *  PRAW_USER_AGENT - keys for Reddit API
    *  TWEEPY_CONSUMER - keys for Twitter API
    *  TWEEPY_SECRET - keys for Twitter API
    *  TWEEPY_ACCESS - keys for Twitter API
    *  TWEEPY_ACCESS_SECRET - keys for Twitter API

# 4️⃣ Testing

🚫Document what you used for testing and why

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

🚫explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

🚫replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
