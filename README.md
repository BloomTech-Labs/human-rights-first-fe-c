## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/QWXanExQ/team-c-2009)

[Technical Architecture and Userflow](https://whimsical.com/8sQcpjw3K2XdAiM9aeMkft)

Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies instances of police use of force across the United States of America for Human Rights First, an independent advocacy and action organization.

### Key Features

- User can view incidents of police brutality and get more information on specific incidents
- User can currently search map based on city and state. In future releases, filters based on type of force and date could be implemented. 


#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_BACKENDURL=
    *  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=

# Testing

No testing implemented as of October 18th, 2020. 

# Installation Instructions

Run 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies. 

## Other Scripts

    * node server.js - must be executed from /server folder - runs local server for development
